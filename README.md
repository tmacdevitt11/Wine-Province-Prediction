# Wine-Province-Prediction
Predicting wine province using tokenization for feature engineering.

## Overview

I want to investigated what are the most common words used to describe Pinotâ€™s from various regions. A secondary part of my analysis will be to run a KNN model to predict what region a wine originates from. 

To accomplish this I will utilize wine data in the following way:
* Utilize tokenization of wine descriptions for analysis
* Create word clouds to highlight most used words
* Engineer dummy variables from tokenization for modeling
